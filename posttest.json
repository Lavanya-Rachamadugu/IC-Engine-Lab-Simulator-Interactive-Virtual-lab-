        "d": "57 kW"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Indicated Power (kW) = Brake Power (kW) / Efficiency = 60 kW / 0.35 ≈ 171.43 kW",
        "b": "Indicated Power (kW) = Brake Power (kW) / Efficiency = 60 kW / 0.35 ≈ 171.43 kW",
        "c": "Indicated Power (kW) = Brake Power (kW) / Efficiency = 60 kW / 0.35 ≈ 171.43 kW",

      "question": "What is the relationship between Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "As Brake Power increases, Mechanical Efficiency increases",
        "b": "As Brake Power increases, Mechanical Efficiency decreases",
        "c": "Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency are not related.",
        "d": "Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency increase proportionally."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency are inversely related. As Brake Power increases, the losses within the engine also increase, leading to a decrease in Mechanical Efficiency.",
        "b": "Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency are inversely related. As Brake Power increases, the losses within the engine also increase, leading to a decrease in Mechanical Efficiency.",
        "c": "Brake Power and Mechanical Efficiency are inversely related. As Brake Power increases, the losses within the engine also increase, leading to a decrease in Mechanical Efficiency.",

      "question": "What is the main advantage of using the Willian's line method in engine performance analysis?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It provides a graphical representation of brake power.",
        "b": "It accurately measures engine friction losses.",

      "question": "The Compression Ratio of a single-cylinder diesel engine is increased. How will it affect the Brake Power?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Brake Power will decrease.",
        "b": "Brake Power will increase.",
        "c": "Brake Power will remain the same.",
        "d": "Brake Power will decrease initially and then increase."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Increasing the Compression Ratio can lead to improved efficiency, but the direct effect on Brake Power is not significant. Therefore, Brake Power will remain relatively constant.",
        "b": "Increasing the Compression Ratio can lead to improved efficiency, but the direct effect on Brake Power is not significant. Therefore, Brake Power will remain relatively constant.",
        "c": "Increasing the Compression Ratio can lead to improved efficiency, but the direct effect on Brake Power is not significant. Therefore, Brake Power will remain relatively constant.",
